# Introduction

This code is a Python script for the SerializingProducer using Avro. The script defines an Avro schema for message records and creates an instance of the AvroSerializer class to serialize the records. It also defines a delivery_report function that reports the failure or success of a message delivery. The main function of the script takes a topic argument, creates an instance of the SerializingProducer class, and produces messages to the specified topic. The produced messages are serialized using the Avro schema defined earlier.

# Dependencies

The code has the following dependencies:

•	confluent_kafka

•	avro_to_python

•	six

The dependencies can be installed using the following command:

**pip install -r requirements.txt**
# Usage
To use the producer, run the following command:

**python <script.py> --bootstrap-servers <kafka_broker_url> --schema-registry <schema_registry_url> --topic <topic_name>**

where:

•	<script.py> is the name of the Python script containing the producer code.

•	<kafka_broker_url> is the URL of the Kafka broker.

•	<schema_registry_url> is the URL of the schema registry.

•	<topic_name> is the name of the Kafka topic where the messages will be sent.

# Code Explanation
The producer code does the following:

1.	Imports the required libraries.
2.	Defines a EventMessage class that represents the message to be sent to Kafka.
3.	Defines a msg_to_dict function that converts the EventMessage object into a dictionary that can be serialized in Avro format.
4.	Defines a delivery_report function that is called when a message is delivered to Kafka.
5.	Defines a main function that sends messages to Kafka.
6.	Reads the schema of the message from a string using the AvscReader class of the avro_to_python library.
7.	Defines a SchemaRegistryClient object that connects to the schema registry using the url parameter.
8.	Defines an AvroSerializer object that serializes messages in Avro format using the SchemaRegistryClient object and the schema of the message.
9.	Defines a dictionary with the configuration of the Kafka producer, including the bootstrap servers, the key serializer, and the value serializer.
10.	Creates a SerializingProducer object that sends messages to Kafka using the configuration and the AvroSerializer object.
11.	Sends a message to Kafka using the produce method of the SerializingProducer object and waits for the message to be delivered using the flush method.
